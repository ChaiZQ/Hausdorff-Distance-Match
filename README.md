# Hausdorff-Distance-Match
This project demostrates how to use Hausdorff distance to do templete matching. Hausdorff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other. we privide CANNY, SURF, SIFT and HARRIS feature points to represent the source image and the templete image, and then find the best match in the source image.
Typically, we need input the source image file, the templete image file and the type of feature point. then we can get the result like this:

**Note that this project just considered translation, it has not considered rotation and scale.**
